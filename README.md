ROBOCar
=======

Python script used in my project ROBOCar which won the "Best Project Award of 2013"at  aDAVitya 13, DAVIET's technical fest.

The major outline of this project is NOT the car itself, as it’s relatively easy and common to make one. The main motive of creating this project was to harness the power of a spectacular device, and the device is….

The Wii Mote!
You must have heard of Nintendo Wii, well, quite obviously it’s controller is called the Wii Mote. It’s a great hacker friendly device, which can be paired with Linux using python. 

But then what?
I interfaced the Wii Mote on my Raspberry Pi to detect key presses, but the best part is, it doesn’t matter anymore! 
The Wii Mote has an inbuilt Accelerometer, and the ROBO Car is controlled by the accelerometer, NOT BY ANY BUTTONS!

But How?	
It was quite a mess when I was working with the accelerometer, but Python made it possible. 
The Car goes forward when you tilt the Wii Mote forward, it goes reverse when you tilt the Wii Mote backwards. Similar for Left and Right as well, just tilt the Mote in either direction.
